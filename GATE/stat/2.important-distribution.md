# Discrete Distribution


### Uniform Discrete Distribution
$$ X \sim Uniform \{a,b\} $$
where $$ X= \{a, a+1,a+2,...,b\}$$

##### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

Probability of each value is equal

\[ P(X = x) = \frac{1}{total~ number}= \frac{1}{b - a + 1} \]


##### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)


\[ F(x) = P(X =< x) = \frac{x - a + 1}{b - a + 1} \]

for \( a \leq x \leq b \).

##### Mean

The mean (expected value) is average of the minimum and maximum values:

\[ \mu = \frac{a + b}{2} \]

##### Variance

\[ \sigma^2 = \frac{(b - a + 1)^2 - 1}{12} \]


# Discrete Distribution


### Poisson Distribution
$X$ = Number of times a particular event happen during a fixed time interval
$X =\{0,1,2,3,4,.....\}$
##### Represent
$$ X \sim Poisson (\mu) $$


##### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

\[ P(X = x) = e^{-\mu} ~\frac{\mu^x}{x!} \]


##### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)


\[ F(x) = P(X =< x) = e^{-\mu} \sum_{i=0}^x  \frac{\mu^i}{i!} \]


##### Mean

The mean (expected value) is average of times an event happen during a fixed time interval

##### Variance
Mean and variance are equal.
\[ \sigma^2 = \mu \]
