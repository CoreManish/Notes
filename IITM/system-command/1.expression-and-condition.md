## Expression envelope
- It is used to envelope some mathematical calculation
##### There are many ways to write expression:
1. Using `let` keyword  
 `let a=$b+5` #No space allowed  
 `let "a = $b + 5"` #space doesn't matter
2. Using Square bracket `$[]`  
   `a=$[ $b + 5]` # Should have spaces
3. Using Double Parenthesis `$(())` # Prefered method  
   `a=$(( $b + 5 ))` # Should have spaces  
   `(( i++ ))` # Increment operator  
   `(( i-- ))` # Decrement operator
4. Using `expr` keyword  
   `a=$( expr $b + 5)` # should have spaces  
   `expr $b+5` # No spaces ,used to just print the evaluated value  # Didn't work  
   `expr "$b + 5"` # Spaces doesn't matter, used to just print evaluated value # Didn't work
   
   
   
 ## Conditional statement envelope
 - It used used to envelope conditional statement
 - Used to envelop conditions of `if-else` `while` `until`
 - We will learn about loop and if-else later.
 - Conditional statement return true or false
 ##### There are many ways to write conditional statement:
 1. Using `test` keyword  
    `test Hello = Hello` # Space doesn't matter
 2. Using square bracket `[]`  
    `[ Hello = Hello ]` # space important
 3. Using double square bracket `[[]]`  # Prefered  
    `[[ Hello = Hello ]]` # Spaces important
 5. Using double parenthesis `(())`  
    `(( Hello = Hello ))` # spaces important # Didn't work
